# osuproject
A osu! project.

This project is made for fun with the aim to understand the distribution of a map amongst the top 10000 global players. The plots show the distribution of accuracy vs pp with different mod combination for a particular map
The maps being used for this are the top5 plays of the top 10000 global players. Some of the players have been emitted due to api issue for mods such as 
Spun Out. However, almost all of the players data is stored in the osudata.csv
