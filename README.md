# osuproject
A osu! project.

This project is made for fun with the aim to understand the distribution of a map amongst the top 10000 global players. The plots show the distribution of accuracy vs pp with different mod combination for a particular map
The maps being used for this are the top5 plays of the top 10000 global players. Some of the players have been emitted due to api issue for mods such as 
Spun Out. However, almost all of the players data is stored in the osudata.csv


The most popular map for the top 10000 globally ranked player is Zan'ei, being in the top 5 for them with a frequency of 1227. The distribution of the mods shows  that only 6 players are able to play the map with Double Time mod. Rest of the players either playing with Hard Rock or No-Mod. Subsequently the performance points rewarded with accuracy between 97-100 is between 400-600, whereas the DoubleTime mod with without full combo provides around 1000 performance points, 
with 2 players getting 1157 and 1240 pp. 

Note that if you go to a map and check the top plays of a map, it need not correspond to the spread because the top 5 plays of a player need not be that map. For example, Player Umbre has the best score on the map Sidetracked day, however, it is not in his top 5 plays. Hence, that won't be shown in the cluster graph. If we plot specifically for a map then we can get the appropriate cluster. Maybe a future work.

The second most popular map was Bass Slut, questionable name. The spread for this map shows that most of the players could play and pass the map with Hidden and Double Time mod combination, which is generally the second most difficult mod combination. More information about the mods and difficulty they cause for a map can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_Setup#difficulty).

The rest of the figures are shown for the top 15 most played maps amongst the top 10000 players. The general format is similar to what is explained before.
